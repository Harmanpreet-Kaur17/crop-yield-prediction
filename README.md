# Crop Yield Prediction

This project predicts agricultural crop yield (hg/ha) using machine learning techniques based on historical and environmental factors.

## Features Used
- Crop type
- Year
- Average rainfall (mm/year)
- Pesticide usage (tonnes)
- Average temperature (°C)

## Machine Learning Model
- Linear Regression
- Label Encoding for categorical crop names

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Docker

## Model Performance
- MAE: ~4562 hg/ha
- R² Score: ~0.98

## Deployment
The project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using Docker.
